Sliding Frank-Wolfe Algorithm for BLASSO

Algorithm that solves the BLASSO using the Sliding Frank-Wolfe (SFW) algorithm. It is based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm but with
an added step, after each creation of a new spike, that moves continuously both the amplitudes and the positions.

The notebook example.ipynb gives a few examples.

Works with Julia 0.5.1
